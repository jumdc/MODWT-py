# MODWT-py
## Implementation of Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform in Python

### Choice of filters
Generally the choice of filters need to be balance between two considerations : 
- wavelets with very short width can introduce undiserable artefacts into the resulting analyses. 
- wavelet filters with large L can be better however more coefficients are influcend by boundary effect, more computationally expensice
